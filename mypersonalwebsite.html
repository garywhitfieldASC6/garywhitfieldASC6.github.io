                <img src= "images/download.jpg" width="350" height=250>
                <p>Born and raised in Brooklyn, Gary had a decent childhood. Ever since he was a child, he had dreamed of becoming a lawyer.
                    He saw the power that Lawyers had possessed and the willpower to do right by the people. With his competitive spirit, and strong-willed 
                    determination. He obtained a law degree once he graduated at Harvard Law, and opened a private law firm three years later. 
                    Once his law firm opened, he saw his dreams come true right in front of his eyes. He wanted to help people who looked like him, and give them the 
                    opportunies to venture out into the field of law. On a personal side, he's a family-oriented man who enjoys traveling and bicycle-riding. 
                    Also, he is a hopeless romatanic who likes spending time with his significant other, and enjoying each other's company.</p>

                <h2>Law in Today's Society</h2>
                <p> The law in today's society is an obstrucure of justice riducled by the arrogance and the ignorance by those who
                governs the law. We the people is an indoctrinated statement that was written by Gouverneur Morris who wanted a unified and junctured
                body of government meaning that the righs and the ammendments imsituted and declared in that statement belongs to everyone, and not only a certain group of people. 
                We see injustice everyday on the news, and yet we have not made any progress towards change and a better future.
                Not only for us, but for the future generations that will come ahead of us. We want to effect change at Law & Legalities Law Firm. 
                As a team, we uphold the moral compasss and the integrity that guides us to the path of righteousness!
